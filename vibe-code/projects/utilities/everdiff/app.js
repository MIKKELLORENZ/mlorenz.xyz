Proliferation and killing
Ki-67: cell-cycle protein → “currently dividing”

MDSC (human, rough gating idea)
CD11b: myeloid backbone → “myeloid cell”
CD33: immature myeloid → “developing myeloid cell”
HLA-DR low/−: low antigen presentation → “suppressive-leaning”
CD14 vs CD15: splits mono- vs granulocytic types

---Stem/progenitor and other lineages---
CD34: stem/progenitor → “immature ‘starter’ blood cells”

--Quick panel tips---
Put dim markers on bright fluorochromes.
Use a dump channel (e.g., CD14, CD19, dead) to clean target gates.
Always titrate antibodies and match controls to fixation/permeabilization.
